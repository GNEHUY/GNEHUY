### Hi there 👋  

😄 I am a second-year master's student at the School of Artificial Intelligence and Data Science, University of Science and Technology of China.

🔭 I'm currently working on Dense Retrieval, Retrieval-Augmented Generation, and LLM for Retrieval. Recently, I've been paying more attention to DeepResearch, AgenticRAG, Retrieval-Augmented Reasoning, Generation-Augmented Retrieval, and the integration of these aforementioned areas with RL.
